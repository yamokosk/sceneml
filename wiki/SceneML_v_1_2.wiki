  * New mesh attribute
    * scale parameter which would allow you to scale up or down a pre-existing mesh. For instance to account for units mis-match
  * Matlab interface
    * Augment the sceneSetVars command to accept different types of data structures. I have two ideas for this.
    #. Structures such as myvars.var1 = pi, myvars.var2 = 2*pi, ...
    #. Sparse arrays where the index of non-zero arrays correspond to the variable ID.
