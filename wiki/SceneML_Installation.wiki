#summary How-to install SceneML.

= Prerequisites =

Like all good open source projects, SceneML stands on the shoulders of giants. It depends on a few other open-source libraries so before installing SceneML go install the following. Installation of these will obviously depend on your platform but all are available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

  * [http://www.ode.org/ ODE] - Physics engine
  * [http://muparser.sourceforge.net/ muParser] - Mathematical expression library
  * [http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/ Xerces-C] - XML parsing library
  * [http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Index.html CMake] - Cross-platform build utility


= Compiling from source =

While some binaries of SceneML, compiling from source is always a good choice if you want to make absolutely sure the library will run on your machine/OS with no problems.

== Windows ==

1. First make sure to install the prerequisites listed above.

2. Set the following environmental variables:
  * ODE_HOME - Point to root directory of your ODE installation
  * MUPARSER_HOME - Point to root directory of your muParser installation
  * XERCES_HOME - Points to the root directory of your Xerces-C installation

3. Point CMake to the lib directory. Hit Configure then OK.
