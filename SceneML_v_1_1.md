# SceneML 1.1 Notes #

## Change Log ##
  * The file parameter for mesh geometries in the scene XML file must now list the location of the OBJ or STL files relative to the location of the scene file.
  * Slight modification of sceneInit.m to account for arbitrary location of the user's scene XML file.
